American Sign Language Recognition Using CNN,ResNet50 and VGG16

The ASL dataset is used for sign language recognition using vgg16, resnet50, and CNN models. This dataset contains various images of people performing ASL signs in different backgrounds and with different variations. The models are trained to recognize these signs and identify them correctly. The accuracy achieved with vgg16, resnet50 and CNN models is quite similar and shows a promising result. The CNN model is able to predict almost accurately the ASL signs in the images. Additionally, the neural networks can be used to further improve the accuracy of the model. By tweaking the hyper-parameters of the network, the accuracy of the model can be improved even further. Therefore, it can be said that sign language recognition using the ASL dataset and the vgg16, resnet50 and CNN models is possible and can be a very helpful tool in understanding sign language.
